FPV Drone Project

This project documents the design and assembly of a high-performance, manual First-Person View (FPV) drone. The drone uses a 5-inch carbon fibre X frame, providing immersive FPV flights with live video transmitted directly to VR goggles. All project components, prices, and quantities are listed in the included `bom.csv` file.

Key Features

- Full manual control: throttle, pitch, roll, and yaw; no auto-stabilization or self-leveling.
- High-definition analogue video delivery for real-time FPV through goggles.
- Impact-absorbing skid guards for safer landings and ground clearance.
- GPS-based fail-safe for recovery and better safety.
- Custom TPU mounts for GPS and antennas to improve signal and durability.

What's Included

- 5-inch carbon fibre X frame.
- 1700Kv brushless motors and compatible ESC + FC stack.
- Analogue FPV camera and video transmitter.
- GPS module, patch antenna, omnidirectional antenna, and custom extension cabling.
- 3D printed skid guards and module mounts.
- Beeper, battery straps, and all necessary accessories for a complete build.

Bill of Materials

The full Bill of Materials, which includes the most up-to-date list of parts, prices, and quantities, is available in 'bom.csv'. 

Assembly Instructions

1. Assemble the carbon fibre frame and securely attach the skid guards and TPU mounts.
2. Install the ESC + FC stack using the appropriate vibration dampening.
3. Mount all motors and connect the wiring according to your flight controller diagram.
4. Attach the FPV camera and VTX, ensuring reliable cabling and power supply.
5. Mount the antennas and GPS using the provided TPU mounts for optimal performance.
6. Secure the receiver, route the antenna wires, and check all solder joints.
7. Add battery straps and a beeper for power and safety during flight.
8. Refer to your flight controller documentation for specific firmware flashing and setup.

Usage

- Bind your radio transmitter and receiver before flight.
- Calibrate and test GPS and fail-safe features thoroughly.
- Power on with VR goggles ready for real-time FPV control.
- Practice manual acrobatics and explorations in open spaces.

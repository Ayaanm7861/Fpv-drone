## 10/26/2025 - Updated Build Design  

The updated design now includes skid guards that provide landing clearance, absorb impact forces, and allow for smooth sliding and skidding. It also features a rear GPS mount with GPS capabilities for fail-safe functionality, a front omnidirectional antenna mount to ensure a reliable video feed without needing to point the antenna toward the drone, and a rear antenna mount that securely holds the antenna responsible for transmitting real-time video to the FPV goggles.![IMG-20251026-WA0017](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NTcxNSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--908907c27b24d0eebe8c3494c1c63008da4e0be4/IMG-20251026-WA0017.jpg)

- Total Expected Weight: About 690 g, including the battery.  
- Frame: 5-inch carbon fibre X frame for strength and agility.  
- Flight Control: Full manual mode without stabilization for a true FPV flying experience.  
- video Transmission: Analogue VTX with a dual antenna setup (omnidirectional and patch) for a reliable FPV feed.  
- Additional Features: Skid guards for protection on impact, GPS module for fail-safe operation, and a beeper for locating the drone.  

- Flight controller and electronic speed controller stack.  
- Brushless 1700Kv motors for aggressive flight.  
- FPV camera and video transmitter.  
- GPS, antennas, beeper, and other accessories.  

Build Considerations

- Careful assembly is needed for vibration isolation and antenna placement.  
- Skid guards to enhance landing durability.  
- Battery and weight balance are essential for the best flight performance.  

 Next Steps

- Finalize the purchase of all components listed in 'bom.csv'.  
- Assemble the frame and mount components according to the design.  
- Calibrate the flight controller and conduct initial tests.  
- Start flight trials to reach speed and control objectives.  ![IMG-20251029-WA0020](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NjcwNiwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--df37c1ce7ee8ed01fb3362f148e56b908c986af8/IMG-20251029-WA0020.jpg)
